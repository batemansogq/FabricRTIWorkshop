# Proctor Guide
## Real Time Intelligence Workshop

Fabric Real Time Intelligence (RTI) in a [Workshop](<https://aka.ms/fabricrtiworkshop>) covers how-to build a Medallion architecture design-pattern by using Real-Time Intelligence.

This asset can be proctor completely by using the [MOAW page](<https://aka.ms/fabricrtiworkshop>). See pre-req(s) to setup Fabric Trial Tenant.

Recommend setting up the tenant prior to the day of the event and completing the lab in the “LabAdmin” workspace as cheat-sheet for participants to leverage. Optionally, attendees may use their own Fabric environment, but it is required to enable Real-Time Dashboards (preview) feature to complete the lab (Section 8 – Building the platform).

If desired, on the day of the event the proctor may create a folder called “Workshop” inside the “LabAdmin” workspace to reproduce the lab live (Section 8 – Building the platform).

Alternatively, after completing the theoretical context, instruct the participants to complete the lab on their own, assist them, and help answer questions by having open discussions. 

If necessary, you can demo the Fabric Copilot that helps you write KQL queries here. 

MS-INTERNAL ONLY: To access "RTA Field Demos" workpace which is an F64 to demo Copilot from a KQL Queryset, join SG "adxdemoenv" on IDWeb via MSFT VPN. 

See [Introduction](<https://aka.ms/fabricrtiworkshop>) section for more info. Proctors may contact: fabricvbdtechleads[at]microsoft[dot]com or rtacat[at]microsoft[dot]com if you need help preparing for your delivery or have additional questions.

## Delivery Guide

This asset can be proctor completely by using the [MOAW page](<https://aka.ms/fabricrtiworkshop>).

If desired, cover the introduction & theoretical context first, or simply skip ahead to Section 8 – Building the platform. The presentation is not required (can only be shared in PDF-format externally). However, the intro & theoretical context should take approximately 30-60 minutes. The purpose is not to read everything verbatim. Attendees will have access to review the MOAW in detail afterwards.

10m Break

Proceed to execute the Hands-On Lab (Section 8 - Building the platform). This should take approximately 1-2 hours. During which time allot for open discussion, questions-and-answers and breaks as necessary.

Conclude the workshop with "Section 9 - Continue your learning" or position a POC next.
