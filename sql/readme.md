# Azure SQL DB

A sample Azure SQL Database should be running already to cover the Fabric shortcuts & Data Factory pipelines part(s) of the [lab](https://aka.ms/fabricrtiworkshop). (ection 8 - Building the platform) 

The `setup.sql` file contains commands to create the sqlread user on the aworks database which contains a sample of **AdventureWorksLT**. This user has already been setup in the `adxdemo.database.windows.net` server for the `aworks` db, but the commands are available here just for reference incase you prefer to create this database on your own enviroment for testing.
