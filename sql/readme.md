# Azure SQL DB

An azure sql database should be already hosted to cover the Fabric Data Factory pipelines part of the lab in section 8 - Building the platform for the [workshop](https://aka.ms/fabricrtiworkshop). 

The `setup.sql` file contains commands to create the sqlread user on the aworks database which contains a sample of AdventureWorksLT. This user has already been setup in the `adxdemo.database.windows.net` server for the `aworks` db, but the commands are available here just for reference incase you prefer to create this database on your own enviroment for testing.
